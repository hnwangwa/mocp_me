# Welcome to MoCP.me!

![alt text](/crispy.jpg?raw=true "The App")

This web application uses computer vision as a way to interact with the Museum of Contemporary Photography (MoCP) collection on user-generated terms.  Since 2012, the collection has been sorted into hashtags to provide students from all over Chicago better access to the online database - we hope to expand on this platform by developing a visual tagging system.  With our application, users will take photos that will be analyzed by [Google Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) and return a relevant photo (based on the hashtags) from the MoCP collection.  The user will then be prompted to re-tag the photograph and to see other photographs tagged similarly. Our goal is to make these tags and the collection more accessible and relatable.
